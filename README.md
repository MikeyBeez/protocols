# Claude Protocol System

**Authoritative repository of all operational protocols for Claude's Brain cognitive architecture.**

## Purpose

This repository serves as the canonical source for all protocols that guide Claude's systematic operations. These protocols provide structured, reliable procedures for:

- Error recovery and uncertainty handling
- User communication and interaction
- Task analysis and approach
- Information integration from multiple sources
- Progress communication during complex tasks
- Git repository creation and management
- And many more operational procedures

## Protocol Hierarchy

### Tier 0: Meta-Protocols
Govern how protocols are created, modified, and managed.

### Tier 1: System Protocols (15 protocols)
Critical operations like initialization, state management, architecture updates.

### Tier 2: Foundation Protocols (5 protocols) ✅ COMPLETE
Core operational protocols with formal trigger conditions:
1. **Error Recovery Protocol** - Systematic error/uncertainty handling
2. **User Communication Protocol** - Context-adaptive interaction
3. **Task Approach Protocol** - Intent analysis vs literal interpretation
4. **Information Integration Protocol** - Multi-source synthesis
5. **Progress Communication Protocol** - User engagement during complex tasks

### Tier 3: Workflow Protocols (18+ protocols)
Development workflows, specialized processes, domain-specific procedures.

### Specialized Protocols
Domain-specific protocols for particular tasks or contexts.

## Using This Repository

### For Claude (AI Assistant)
1. Clone this repo to have local access to all protocols
2. Reference protocols when their trigger conditions are met
3. Follow protocols systematically for reliable operations
4. Update protocols when procedures are improved

### For Humans
1. Browse protocols to understand Claude's systematic approaches
2. Modify protocols to improve procedures
3. Create new protocols for new systematic needs
4. Use as templates for your own operational procedures

## Protocol Format

Each protocol includes:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this solve?
- **Trigger Conditions**: When should this activate?
- **Prerequisites**: What must be true before starting?
- **Step-by-Step Procedure**: Exact steps to follow
- **Error Recovery**: What to do when things go wrong
- **Quality Checks**: How to verify success
- **Success Indicators**: What does "done" look like?

## Currently Available Protocols

See [MASTER_INDEX.md](MASTER_INDEX.md) for the complete list.

**Status**: 5 foundation protocols complete, ~50+ protocols to be created/restored.

## Contributing

Protocols are created through actual usage and refinement:
1. Identify a recurring task that needs systematization
2. Document the procedure that works
3. Refine through repeated use
4. Add trigger conditions and error recovery
5. Commit to this repository
6. Update MASTER_INDEX.md

## Synchronization

This repository synchronizes with:
- **Obsidian Vault**: `/Users/bard/Documents/Obsidian/Protocols/`
- **MCP Protocols Server**: Hardcoded protocol content
- **Brain State Table**: Protocol metadata and activation tracking

## Version Control

- Each protocol has a version number (e.g., v1.1.0)
- Major version changes indicate breaking changes
- Minor version changes add features/improvements
- Patch version changes fix errors or clarify

## License

MIT License - These protocols are open for anyone to use, modify, and adapt.

## Acknowledgments

These protocols emerged from 6+ months of AI-human collaboration, capturing systematic approaches that actually work in practice.
