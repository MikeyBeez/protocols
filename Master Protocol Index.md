# Master Protocol Index
*Last Updated: August 19, 2025 - Added Information Retrieval Decision Protocol*

## Overview
This index provides a complete view of the hierarchical protocol system. All protocols were created based on observed patterns from actual tool usage, not theoretical frameworks. The foundation protocols were codified in a remarkable 16-minute session on August 3, 2025.

## Quick Access
- 🚨 **Error/Problem**: [[Error Recovery Protocol v1.2.0]]
- 🤔 **Unclear request**: [[Task Approach Protocol v1.2.0]]

   - Trigger: Any information request or unknown entity

7. **[[Web Search Decision Protocol v1.0.0]]** (August 20)
   - Systematic framework for when to use web search vs other sources
   - Unknown terms, current events, verification decisions
   - Trigger: Unknown terms, recent events, user asks to search/verify

8. **[[Context Window Loading Protocol v1.0.0]]** (August 20)
   - Write to file → read file → delete file pattern for context loading
   - Ensures claimed "loaded" content is actually in context window
   - Trigger: Tools claim to load content, need to verify context contents

9. **[[Context Window Extraction Protocol v1.0.0]]** (August 20)
   - Verify what's actually in context vs what tools claim
   - No tools needed to access truly loaded content
   - Trigger: Need to verify context contents, distinguish loaded vs accessible

10. **[[Tool Modification Protocol v1.0.0]]** (August 20)
    - Handle Claude's inability to restart tools after modification
    - Modify → ask user to restart → wait for confirmation
    - Trigger: Any tool modification that requires restart

11. **[[Hardcoded Paths Protocol v1.0.0]]** (August 20)
    - Two-tier system: most-used paths in smarts, others in protocol lookup
    - Eliminates inefficient path searches for all system files
    - Trigger: Need to access brain files, Obsidian vault, core project paths

12. **[[Stale Continuation Notes Protocol v1.0.0]]** (August 20)
    - Never delete continuation notes until replaced
    - Staleness detection prevents context loss from unexpected session ends
    - Trigger: Session start, unexpected session end, long gaps between sessions

### Tier 3: Workflow Protocols (Specialized)
1. [[Implementation First Protocol v1.2.0]] - Practical implementation focus
2. [[Text Replacement Automation Protocol v1.0.0]] - Automate macOS text replacements via plist
3. [[Bob Project Development Protocol v1.0.0]] - Prevent Claude/Bob system confusion
4. Protocol Compliance Monitoring Protocol (planned)
5. Continuous System Maintenance Protocol (planned)
6. Development Workflow Protocol (planned)
7. Research Methodology Protocol (planned)
8. Diagnostic Protocol (planned)

## Historical Context

### August 3, 2025: Foundation Protocol Creation
In a 16-minute session (15:43-15:59), five foundation protocols were created:
- 15:43:23 — Information Integration Protocol
- 15:43:36 — User Communication Protocol
- 15:58:48 — Progress Communication Protocol
- 15:59:36 — Error Recovery Protocol
- August 11 — Task Approach Protocol completed

### Key Insights
- **Pattern-First Design**: Protocols created AFTER patterns emerged
- **Reality-Grounded**: Based on actual usage, not theory
- **Immediately Practical**: Grounded in reality for instant adoption
- **35% Complexity Reduction**: Through template system

## Access Methods

### Via MCP Protocols Tool
```
protocols:protocol_index          # View this index
protocols:protocol_read <id>       # Read specific protocol
protocols:protocol_search <query>  # Search by keywords
protocols:protocol_triggers <situation>  # Get recommendations
protocols:protocol_list            # List all protocols
```

### Via Brain System
When `brain:brain_init_v5_working` is called:
1. Loads 5 fundamental protocols
2. Includes protocol usage instructions
3. Manages context with 5% protocol overhead
4. Detects additional protocols based on intent

### Via Obsidian
All protocols are stored in `/Users/bard/Documents/Obsidian/Protocols/`
Each protocol is a markdown file with version numbers.
